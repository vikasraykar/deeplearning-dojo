    " ## Task description\n",
    "\n",
    " The goal is to learn to predict whether new molecules will be musks or non-musks.\n",
    "\n",
    " This dataset describes a set of **102 molecules** of which 39 are judged by human experts to be musks\n",
    " and the remaining 63 molecules are judged to be non-musks. The goal is to learn to predict\n",
    " whether new molecules will be musks or non-musks. Each molecule is described by a set of **166 features**.\n",
    "\n",
    " However, the 166 features that describe these molecules depend upon the exact shape,\n",
    " or conformation, of the molecule.  Because bonds can rotate, a single molecule can adopt\n",
    " many different shapes.  To generate this data set, all the low-energy conformations of the\n",
    " molecules were generated to produce **6,598 conformations**.  Then, a feature vector was extracted\n",
    " that describes each conformation.\n",
    "\n",
    " ### Ids\n",
    "\n",
    " `molecule-name` Symbolic name of each molecule.  Musks have names such as MUSK-188.\n",
    " Non-musks have names such as NON-MUSK-jp13.\n",
    "\n",
    " `conformation_name` - Symbolic name of each conformation.  These have the format MOL_ISO+CONF,\n",
    " where MOL is the molecule number, ISO is the stereoisomer number (usually 1), and CONF is the\n",
    " conformation number.\n",
    "\n",
    " ### Features\n",
    "\n",
    " `f1` through `f162`: These are *distance features* along rays.\n",
    "\n",
    " The distances are measured in hundredths of Angstroms.  The distances may be negative or positive,\n",
    " since they are actually measured relative to an origin placed along each ray.  The origin was\n",
    " defined by a \"consensus musk\" surface that is no longer used.\n",
    " Hence, any experiments with the data should treat these feature values as lying on an\n",
    " arbitrary continuous scale.  In particular, the algorithm should not make any use of the\n",
    " zero point or the sign of each feature value.\n",
    "\n",
    " `f163` This is the distance of the oxygen atom in the molecule to a designated point in 3-space.\n",
    "  This is also called OXY-DIS.\n",
    " `f164` OXY-X: X-displacement from the designated point.\n",
    " `f165` OXY-Y: Y-displacement from the designated point.\n",
    " `f166` OXY-Z: Z-displacement from the designated point.\n",
    "\n",
